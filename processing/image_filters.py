'''
This file is responsible for:

Containing image processing functions using OpenCV.

Taking input images (usually as NumPy arrays) and returning processed images.

Encapsulating specific image operations like grayscale conversion, edge detection, blurring, etc.

Keeping the image processing logic independent from the GUI.

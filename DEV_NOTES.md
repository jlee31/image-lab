# Things I want to Have
- some type of text to speech
- some kind of notification

### TTS Ideas:

- Add tutorial mode with TTS 

- Add action feedback (e.x add a button that describes what the tool does)

### Notification ideas:

- pop up that happens when the filter is successful

- errors or warnings 

- Let the user enable or disable TTS/notifications via a Settings panel.

### Adding AI/ML Features

- 4. Face Detection and Editing
Use pre-trained face detectors (OpenCV DNN face detector or models like MTCNN).
Add smart filters or glitch effects only to faces or detect smiles, eyes, etc.

- 2. Super-Resolution / Image Upscaling
Integrate an ML model (e.g., ESRGAN) that enhances image resolution without losing detail.

Useful for improving image quality, could be a button like "Enhance Image".

Random:
Host your code on GitHub and add a README explaining AI features with screenshots or demo GIFs.
Include performance benchmarks or visual comparisons for ML-enhanced filters.
If you implement a GUI feature showing "AI processing in progress", thatâ€™s a good UX highlight.
Write a short blog post or demo video to showcase the AI-powered parts.
Consider packaging the app with PyInstaller for distribution.
